0	 :The facts, as you appear to have spelled out, are that BillyBoy copied Schiaparelli's design too. I saw criticism of Perret for copying Schiaprelli's dress, which I agree with personally, but by that same reasoning, BillyBoy should be criticised too for copying Schiaparelli's designs and taking credit for them as his own work. By this reasoning one copyist would be just as bad as another, regardless of how much a fan or an admirer of their subject's work they are. Because Schiaparelli worked closely with so many contemporary artists, it is interesting to note (in passing) that an artist copied one of her best-known artist collaborations for their own installation for a recent major show, and there is a reference for this. I will look at the Billyboy references, thank you for pointing out where they are located as the webpage is very badly designed and difficult to navigate. :I also see where you accused me of having a conflict of interest. Please do explain this accusation, I am incredibly interested to know where that came from as it seems very out of the blue.
